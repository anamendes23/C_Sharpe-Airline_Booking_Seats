This project is a college class final Review.
The .doc document has all the questions and requirements for the code.

For the airline booking seats exercise, I added the option to book seats clicking on buttons that represent these seats.
It was a good exercise to create componentes using code instead of the design view, which is more efficient when you have a great number
of componentes. Is this case, 80 buttons.
